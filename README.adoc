= PgScribe

PgScribe is a simple ETL PostgreSQL database utility designed to reproduce subsets of data.
Just like a medieval scribe, it may copy only parts of a source or modify it in the process of copying.

This allows database administrators to mirror redacted data sets from Customer Data Environments (CDE) into less sensitive data environments, e.g. for analysis, with Personally Indentifiable Information (PII) staying protected.

== Features

- Selective data copying: Choose specific data to transfer between databases.
- Schema updates: Automatically update the target database's schema when needed.
- Data modification: Modify data during the copying process.

== License

PgScribe is licensed under the GPL 3.0 or later License.
